        <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>This project provides an in-depth analysis of financial indicators across different sectors and how they correlate with stock performance. By utilizing advanced data visualization techniques, we uncover hidden patterns and insights that inform strategic investment decisions.</p>
        <p>Source: The dataset is hosted on Kaggle and consists of financial data for US stocks over five years, from 2014 to 2018.</p>
        <p>Size and Content: The particular file we are focusing on is '2018_Financial_Data.csv'. The dataset includes a wide range of financial indicators, totaling over 200 different metrics. These metrics encompass various aspects of a company's financial health and performance, such as revenue growth, profit margins, operational efficiency, debt levels, and cash flow metrics. The dataset is comprehensive, covering a significant number of US-listed companies across various sectors. This allows for a detailed analysis of sector-specific trends and comparisons.</p>
        <p>We will only be using these columns to analyze if there is a correlation between sector-wise financial indicators and stock performance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Sector</li>
            <li>2. 2019 Price VAR</li>
            <li>3. Revenue Growth</li>
            <li>4. Gross profit margin</li>
            <li>5. Operating income</li>
            <li>6. EBITDA margin</li>
            <li>7. Debt to Equity</li>
            <li>8. ROE</li>
            <li>9. R&D expense growth</li>
            <li>10. Free Cash Flow</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
        <p>In this project, we have investigated the connection between sector-specific financial indicators and stock performance, revealing notable patterns and correlations through data visualization. Our findings indicate particular metrics, such as R&D investment and debt levels, have varying impacts on stock valuations across different industries. These insights lay the groundwork for future research, where advanced statistical methods and predictive modeling can be applied to enhance investment strategies and inform economic policy decisions. Moving forward, we aim to integrate more complex algorithms and expansive datasets to refine our understanding of the financial market's multifaceted nature. Our visualizations can also be updated with new stock data and investors can use it to be more informative when making investment decisions.</p>
